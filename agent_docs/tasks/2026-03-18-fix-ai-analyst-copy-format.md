# Task: Fix AI Analyst Copy-Paste Formatting

## Issue
When copying assessment text from the AI Analyst panel and pasting it into external apps like Notepad, the text appeared with one word per line. This was caused by two factors:
1. **Carriage Returns**: SSE streams using CRLF were leaking `\r` characters into the state. While browsers collapse these in normal rendering, Notepad interprets them as line breaks.
2. **Raw Token Copying**: The "COPY" button used the raw string from the LLM, which often contains streaming artifacts like unnecessary spaces and inconsistent newlines that the UI was hiding via selective rendering, but the clipboard was preserving.

## Solution
Implemented a multi-stage cleanup and normalization process for the analysis text.

### 1. SSE Stream Normalization
Modified `frontend/src/hooks/useAnalysis.ts` to strip trailing `\r` from every SSE line before appending to the state. This ensures the source data is clean from the start.

### 2. Robust Text Formatting Utility
Created `formatAnalysisText` in `AIAnalystPanel.tsx` which handles:
- **Header Normalization**: Ensures standard spacing around `**Section:**` titles.
- **Punctuation Fixing**: Collapses spaces before period, comma, etc.
- **Artifact Cleanup**: Fixes `it ' s` -> `it's` and similar quote-spacing issues.
- **Whitespace Collapse**: Normalizes multiple spaces into single spaces and ensures no more than two consecutive newlines (for paragraph separation).

### 3. Unified Rendering and Copying
Updated both the `AnalysisFormatter` component and the `handleCopy` function to use the same `formatAnalysisText` helper. This guarantees that "What You See Is What You Copy".

## Changes
- `frontend/src/hooks/useAnalysis.ts`: Added `.replace(/\r$/, '')` to SSE line processing.
- `frontend/src/components/widgets/AIAnalystPanel.tsx`: 
    - Extracted and improved text cleaning logic into `formatAnalysisText`.
    - Updated `handleCopy` to use cleaned text.
    - Updated `AnalysisFormatter` to use cleaned text.

## Verification
- Verified code changes locally.
- Checked regex patterns for edge cases (bold headers, punctuation).
- Ensured "COPY" button state (COPIED checkmark) still functions correctly.

## Benefits
- Improved UX: Users can now share and document AI assessments without manual reformatting.
- Visual Quality: The "Premium" aesthetics of the platform are preserved even when data leaves the app.
- Robustness: Handles inconsistent outputs from different LLM engines (local vs. remote) gracefully.
