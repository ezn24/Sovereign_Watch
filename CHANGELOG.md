## [0.28.2] - 2026-03-13

Front End Updates

### Changed

- **Frontend Code Cleanup**: Comprehensive dead code removal and refactor across the frontend codebase.
  - **`useAnimationLoop.ts`**: Removed unused `useMemo` import; removed `mapToken` and `mapStyle` from hook options (never read inside the loop); removed dead `speedKts` computation that was calculated every frame then discarded; removed invalid `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/purity` comment; extracted duplicated sea/air entity filter logic into a standalone `filterEntity()` helper; extracted duplicated satellite category classification into a standalone `filterSatellite()` helper, eliminating verbatim duplication between the orbital count pass and the rendered satellite pass.
  - **`useEntityWorker.ts`**: Removed misleading `smoothedCourse` alias — the variable was assigned directly from `computedCourse` with no transformation, implying smoothing that no longer exists.
  - **`useMissionLocations.ts`**: Removed `updateMission` — defined, memoised, and exported but never imported or called anywhere in the codebase.
  - **`useRFSites.ts`**: Removed `rfSites` array state and `error` state from the hook; both were populated but never consumed by any component. The hook now returns only `{ rfSitesRef, loading }`.
  - **`useMissionArea.ts`**: Removed 4 debug `console.log` statements that fired on every 2-second poll cycle and every mission change.
  - **`useSystemHealth.ts`**: Removed dead `if (latency > 1000) status = 'degraded'` branch — unreachable because the preceding `latency > 200` condition already set the same value.
  - **`useInfraData.ts`**: Removed duplicate consecutive `setOutagesData(fallbackEmpty)` call in the `catch` block.
  - **`missionArea.ts`**: Replaced hardcoded `VITE_API_URL` base URL with relative `/api/config/location` paths, consistent with all other API modules.
  - **`App.tsx`**: Collapsed two identical `<SidebarRight>` renders (one under `TACTICAL`, one under `ORBITAL`) into a single conditional render.
  - **`TacticalMap.tsx` / `OrbitalMap.tsx`**: Removed `mapToken` and `mapStyle` props from `useAnimationLoop` calls after those options were removed from the hook interface.
  - **`replayUtils.test.ts`**: Replaced trivial benchmark test (`expect(end - start).toBeGreaterThan(0)`) with a meaningful data-integrity assertion verifying all entities and point counts are preserved across a large dataset. Removed in-test `console.log`.
  - **Multiple components**: Removed invalid `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/purity` and `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` comments from `PassPredictorWidget.tsx`, `SearchWidget.tsx`, `SidebarRight.tsx`, `KiwiNodeBrowser.tsx`, and `TacticalMap.tsx` — these ESLint rule names do not exist.

Backend Updates

### Fixed

- **RF Alias Endpoint**: Corrected `service=` keyword argument to `services=["ham"]` in the `/api/repeaters` backwards-compatibility alias; previously caused a `TypeError` at runtime on every call.
- **Internet Outage Poller**: Removed an unreachable duplicate `except` block in `fetch_internet_outages()` that could never execute; only the first handler ran.
- **Analysis Request Schema**: Removed unused `uid` field from `AnalyzeRequest` — the entity identifier is correctly sourced from the URL path parameter and the body field was validated but silently ignored.
- **AIS Ingestion Pipeline**: Resolved a critical regression where AIS-sourced maritime vessels were not appearing on the Tactical Map.
  - **Missing `await`**: The `publish_tak_event` coroutine was called without `await` in the main message loop, causing all Kafka sends to be silently dropped.
  - **Interruptible Stream Loop**: Redesigned the main WebSocket receive loop to use `asyncio.wait` with a `reconnect_event`, allowing the poller to immediately react to mission area updates from Redis without blocking.
  - **Classification Key Alignment**: The historian and Intelligence Feed expected a `classification` key on each TAK event; the poller was only emitting `vesselClassification`. Both keys are now populated for full pipeline compatibility.
  - **`ShipType` Field Fix**: `StaticDataReport` (Class B, Message 24) messages use `ShipType` instead of `Type` for the vessel category. `handle_static_data` now checks both keys.
  - **`ShipName` Fallback**: Added `ShipName` as a secondary lookup in `handle_static_data` for vessels whose static data does not carry a `Name` field.
- **AIS Classification Heuristics**: Significantly expanded name-based vessel classification in `maritime_poller/classification.py` to reduce `[UNKNOWN]` tags in the Intelligence Stream.
  - **Passenger/Ferries**: Added `WSF`, `FERRY`, `SPIRIT`, `QUEEN`, `BREEZE` patterns.
  - **Tug/Towing**: Added `FOSS`, `PUSH`, `VALIANT`, `TITAN` patterns.
  - **Military**: Added `CGC`, `RFA` patterns; broadened `USS` to include full prefix.
  - **Pleasure Craft**: Added `MY `, `M/Y`, `SY ` patterns.
  - **Law Enforcement**: Added `POLICE`, `SHERIFF`, `PATROL` patterns.
  - **SAR**: Broadened match from `SAR ` to `SAR`.


### Changed

- **Dead Code Removal**: Deleted several unused code paths identified during backend code review:
  - `teme_to_ecef_vectorized` in `sgp4_utils.py` — replaced by `teme_to_ecef` scalar variant, never imported.
  - Intel Reports stub in `analysis.py` — commented-out embedding scaffolding and `intel_reports = []` placeholder removed along with the now-unused `json` import.
  - `calculate_polling_points()` in `aviation_poller/service.py` — superseded by H3 sharding, no remaining call sites.
  - `poll_point()` in `multi_source_poller.py` — superseded by the H3 `source_loop`/`_fetch` path, no remaining call sites.
  - `Settings.LITELLM_MODEL` in `config.py` — `AI_MODEL_DEFAULT` in `system.py` is the actual source of truth; this setting was never read.
- **Import Hygiene**: Moved inline `import math` to the top of `infra_poller/main.py`; removed unused `import sys` from `benchmark_search.py`; removed unused `List` from `multi_source_poller.py` imports.
- **Redis Cleanup Guards**: Simplified `hasattr(x, 'aclose')` ternary guards in `database.py` and `aviation_poller/service.py` to direct `aclose()` calls — `redis.asyncio` has provided this method since v4.2 and the fallback is no longer needed.

### Removed

- **Infra Poller Debug Scripts**: Deleted 6 one-off HTTP probe scripts from `backend/ingestion/infra_poller/test/` (`debug_ioda_structure.py`, `test_ioda.py`, `test_ioda_events.py`, `test_ioda_events_refined.py`, `test_ioda_summary.py`, `test_ioda_summary_v2.py`) — these made live network calls and were not pytest-compatible unit tests.
- **Orbital Pulse Test Directory**: Moved `benchmark_parsing.py` from `orbital_pulse/tests/` to the package root and removed the now-empty `tests/` directory.

JS8CALL Updates

### Changed

- **JS8Call — Dead Code Removal**: Audited all files in the `js8call/` poller for dead code, unused symbols, and structural redundancies.
  - Removed unused `import shlex` from `server.py` (was made redundant when `shell=True` was replaced with secure subprocess pipelines).
  - Removed unused `import sys` from `manual_test_kiwi.py`.
  - Removed unused `import traceback` from `tests/test_json.py`.
  - Removed three dead dummy-variable assignments (`callsign`, `grid`, `freq`) that were immediately overwritten in the WebSocket handler.
  - Removed dead `haversine_distance_km()` function from `server.py` — duplicate of logic already present in `kiwi_directory.py` and never called.
  - Removed no-op `if closed_ok: pass` branch from `kiwi_client.py` receive loop.
  - Consolidated five repeated inline `socket.socket()` UDP send blocks in `server.py` into a single `_udp_send()` helper, reducing boilerplate and centralising error handling.
  - Fixed type mismatch: `SET_KIWI` handler now correctly parses `freq` as `int` (was `float`), matching the `_start_kiwi_pipeline()` signature and validation logic.
  - Renamed root-level `test_kiwi.py` → `manual_test_kiwi.py` and `test_wvm.py` → `manual_test_wvm.py` to clearly distinguish live integration/smoke scripts from the pytest unit test suite in `tests/`.

## [0.28.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Waterfall Zoom Suite**: Integrated dynamic zoom capabilities into the KiwiSDR waterfall.
  - **Dynamic Scaling**: The waterfall now correctly follows the audio center frequency even when zoomed in.
  - **Zoom Controls**: Added interactive zoom +/- buttons to the Listening Post panel.
- **Global Network Master Toggle**: Refined the "Global Network" infrastructure toggle with a hierarchical master switch that controls Undersea Cables and Internet Outages as a group.

### Fixed

- **Map Depth Sorting Optimization**: Standardized depth stacking across the tactical stack. Entity icons and trails now correctly "float" above high-density infrastructure layers like Internet Outages and Submarine Cables.
- **Globe Projection Refinements**:
  - Fixed a visual glitch where AOT boundaries would "clip" or distort when transitioning to Globe mode by implementing geodesic path rendering.
  - Fixed a mission-area rendering bug in maritime AOTs by implementing box-edge interpolation for the Earth's curvature.
- **Map Style Lifecycle**: Resolved an issue where the map would remain stuck in satellite mode after exiting Globe view; it now correctly reverts to the tactical dark style.
- **Waterfall Dynamic Range**: Improved waterfall contrast through precise dynamic range calibration and a refined spectral palette.

### Changed

- **Tactical HUD Condensation**: Optimized vertical spacing in the Listening Post sidebar to reduce scrolling and improve situational awareness.
- **Documentation Migration**: Completed the transition of all persistent documentation from `docs/` to `agent_docs/` for better agent resonance.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Internet Outage Intelligence Layer**: Implemented a global internet outage visualization layer powered by Georgia Tech's IODA (Internet Outage Detection and Analysis).
  - **Dynamic Country Shading**: Countries are now dynamically shaded on the map based on the severity of active internet outages, using a multi-stage heatmap (Yellow → Orange → Red).
  - **Tactical Outage Reports**: Added a dedicated "INTERNET OUTAGE" sidebar section that surfaces IODA scores, affected regions, and data-source attribution for selected countries.
- **`infra_poller` Microservice**: New Python-based ingestion service that centralizes high-latency infrastructure data fetching.
  - **IODA Summary V2**: Optimized ingestion using the IODA Summary V2 API with hourly rolling windows.
  - **Submarine Cable Refresh**: Automated 24h background polling for global submarine cable and landing station datasets.
  - **Redis-Backed Infrastructure Store**: Migrated infrastructure data to a shared Redis cache to improve frontend load times and reduce external API dependency.
- **Hierarchical Global Network Toggle**: Re-engineered the "GLOBAL NETWORK" filter into a master switch that controls Undersea Cables, Landing Stations, and Internet Outages as a unified group.
- **Undersea Cables Sub-filter**: Added granular control for cable paths, allowing them to be toggled independently once the master network switch is active.

### Changed

- **Depth Bias Recalibration**: Standardized `depthBias` across the tactical stack to resolve visibility conflicts. Internet Outages (-30) and Physical Infrastructure (-40) now correctly render beneath AOT Boundaries (-100) and Entity Icons (-200).
- **Layer Stacking Optimization**: Refined the global rendering order to ensure static infrastructure remains a background "underlay" while real-time tactical data stays prominent on top.
- **Improved Interaction Model**: Migrated outage interaction from point-based markers to native GeoJSON polygon picking, enabling users to select entire countries for detailed outage analysis.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Hybrid Globe Architecture**: Integrated ESRI World Imagery satellite basemap as a high-resolution alternative to the dark tactical style in Globe mode.
- **Deep Space Starfield**: Implemented a dynamic StarField canvas with 320 twinkling stars, rendered behind the map to provide a cinematic backdrop when atmospheric layers are translucent.
- **Globe Style Switcher**: New `DARK` / `SAT` toggle buttons exclusively in Globe mode for seamless transition between tactical and reconnaissance views.
- **Atmospheric Tuning**: Refined the globe's atmosphere in `useMapCamera.ts` to allow starfield visibility while maintaining a high-altitude glow.

### Changed

- **Adaptive Map UI**: 2D and 3D views are now forced to the high-contrast Dark Tactical style for optimal UI performance and legibility. Satellite imagery is dynamically restricted to the Globe projection.
- **Control Bar Refinement**: Repositioned 3D orientation controls (Rotation/Tilt) to sit above the mode selector for improved ergonomics.
- **Orbital Parity**: Added full 3D orientation controls to the `OrbitalMap.tsx` component.
- **Graticule Color Logic**: Latitude/Longitude grid lines now dynamically adjust contrast based on the underlying basemap (White on Satellite vs Cyan on Dark).

### Fixed

- **High-Load AIS Stability**: Implemented an exponential backoff (5s to 300s) and a 30s minimum cooldown strategy for the maritime poller to prevent IP rate-limiting during rapid mission re-centering.
- **Websocket Lifecycle**: Fixed an `AttributeError` in `service.py` where stale connection delay variables were causing poller crashes during reconnection cycles.
- **Orbital UI Missing Assets**: Resolved a `ReferenceError` in `OrbitalMap.tsx` where move/tilt icons were missing from the `lucide-react` module imports.
- **Layer Re-application**: Fixed a bug where graticule and background layers would disappear after basemap style changes by migrating to persistent `.on("style.load")` listeners in `MapboxAdapter.tsx`.

## [0.26.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **KiwiSDR Tuning Stability**: Implemented a 500ms debouncing mechanism for frequency tuning, AGC, and squelch adjustments in the `js8call` service. This prevents remote SDR nodes from being overwhelmed by rapid UI interactions and mitigates connection drops and rate-limiting.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **HF Listening Post (Beta)**: Integrated a high-performance raw binary streaming architecture for KiwiSDR nodes. Users can now stream real-time 12kHz PCM audio and panoramic waterfall data directly to the Radio Terminal.
- **Panoramic Waterfall (WVM/WF)**: New high-density spectrum visualization in the Listening Post panel, synchronized with the active SDR frequency and zoom levels.

### Fixed

- **AIS AOT Persistence**: Resolved a race condition where the maritime Area of Interest (AOT) boundary would flicker or disappear when switching between Tactical, Orbital, and Radio views. State is now persisted via root refs.
- **KiwiSDR Protocol Handshake**: Fixed a critical command sequencing bug in `kiwi_client.py` that caused audio/waterfall streams to hang during initialization.
- **Audio Stream Resilience**: Implemented non-blocking I/O for the JS8Call audio pipeline to prevent event-loop stalls during buffer saturation.
- **WebSocket Auto-Reconnect**: Added robust reconnection logic to HF audio and waterfall streams to handle backend service restarts gracefully.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Global COT State Persistence**: Re-engineered the map view lifecycle by hoisting the `useEntityWorker` hook and all tactical track state to the root `App.tsx`. This ensures that tactical tracks, dead reckoning state, and satellite telemetry persist instantly when switching between Tactical and Orbital map views.

### Fixed

- **Map View Transition Performance**: Eliminated the 5-10 second "re-sync" delay when switching map views by preserving the WebSocket and Worker thread throughout the session.
- **State Reset Bug**: Fixed a critical `TypeError` in `App.tsx` where changing map filters would crash the application due to a missing return in the `setFilters` state updater.
- **Prop Consistency**: Corrected `alertedEmergencyRef` and `repeatersLoading` type mismatches and interface duplications across `App.tsx`, `TacticalMap.tsx`, and `OrbitalMap.tsx`.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **System Settings Widget**: New centralized configuration interface for system-level toggles, accessible via the Top Bar "SYS" button. Currently houses the H3 Poller mesh toggle.
- **H3 Coverage Mesh**: Real-time H3-based coverage visualization on the Tactical Map, providing spatial awareness of active sensor footprints and poller density.

### Fixed

- **AIS Poller Footprint Optimization**: Standardized AIS ingestion to a fixed 350 NM radius per mission area to prevent reconnection churn while filtering visible data locally.
- **H3 Layer Rendering**: Optimized H3 mesh with `depthTest: false` and `depthWrite: false` to ensure perfect visibility of grounded tactical entities (AIS/ADS-B) regardless of mesh overlay.
- **System UI Centering**: Re-aligned the System Settings widget to be perfectly centered beneath the "SYS" button with corrected horizontal translation.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Multi-Source RF Pulse Poller**: Refactored RF infrastructure ingestion into a single, highly concurrent Python microservice (`rf_pulse`) replacing disparate scripts. Supports RepeaterBook, RadioReference, Amateur Radio Directory (ARD), and NOAA NWR.
- **RadioReference Integration**: Secured trunked/conventional system ingestion via authenticated SOAP requests using the user's `RADIOREF_APP_KEY`.
- **Repeater Band Classification**: The Tactical Sidebar now actively computes and displays the physical frequency band (e.g., `2m`, `70cm`, `GMRS (UHF)`) as a compact visual badge attached to the header.

### Changed

- **RF Infrastructure Documentation**: Expanded the `README.md` to cleanly document the `rf_pulse` configuration variables, pipeline architecture, and supported upstream APIs.

## [0.22.1] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- **KiwiSDR Node Limits:** Increased the backend node limit from 50 to 10,000 to enable the frontend "Global" radius toggle to correctly display all cached KiwiSDR receivers.
- **Node Filtering Logic:** Updated the `useKiwiNodes` hook to properly trigger refetches when node limits change. Hardcoded limits applied to Mission (50), Regional (500), and Global (All) modes.
- **Tactical Map Controls:** Restored MapLibre `NavigationControl` (+/- zoom buttons) to the bottom-right of the tactical map and themed them in the Sovereign Glass style. Extracted MapLibre CSS overrides from Tailwind's `@layer` directive to prevent the JIT compiler from purging them.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **RF Network Refactor**: Complete architectural overhaul of the Radio Frequency ingestion pipeline, now supporting concurrent polling for multiple service types (Ham/GMRS, NOAA Weather Radio, and Public Safety/RadioReference).
- **AOR Boundary Ring**: Implemented a dynamic, dashed amber horizon ring on the Tactical Map that scales with the selected RF survey radius, providing instant situational awareness of hardware range.
- **Service-Aware Clustering**: Refined map clustering logic to group RF sites by service type, maintaining distinct color-coding (Emerald/Sky/Amber) for high-density visualization.
- **RF Range Expansion**: Extended the operational range limits for RF surveys, now supporting presets up to 2,000 NM with optimized backend query logic.

### Changed

- **RF UI Standardization**: Migrated the RF Infrastructure suite to a high-contrast amber-yellow theme, differentiating polling status from tactical entities.
- **Condensed Service Filters**: Refactored RF sub-filters into a single horizontal row of high-contrast glowing buttons for better vertical space efficiency.
- **Viewport Optimization**: Increased the Map Layers panel's maximum height from 40vh to 60vh to prevent layout cramping when multiple service suites are expanded.
- **Ref Sites Caching**: Implemented a more aggressive caching strategy in `useRFSites` with TTL and movement-based refetch thresholds to reduce API load.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **JS8 Unified State Management**: Refactored the `useJS8Stations` hook to serve as the single source of truth for all JS8-related telemetry, ensuring perfect synchronization between the Tactical Map widget and the Radio Terminal panel.
- **Premium Radio Beacon Icon**: Implemented a high-tech, multi-layered "Radio Beacon" icon for connected KiwiSDR nodes on the tactical map, featuring pulsing core animations, radiating cyan waves, and breathing attention rings for enhanced situational awareness.

### Changed

- **KiwiSDR Beacon Scaling**: Refined the radii and font sizes of the map beacon by ~40% for better proportionality within the tactical view.
- **Radio Terminal Variable Standardization**: Standardized all internal variable names in `RadioTerminal.tsx` (`bridgeConnected`, `kiwiIsConnecting`, `sharedStatusLine`, etc.) to match the unified state provider.

### Fixed

- **Radio Terminal `ReferenceError`**: Resolved a critical bug that caused the Radio Terminal view to crash due to undefined variable references after the state refactor.
- **JS8 Connection "Stuck" State**: Fixed a UI bug where connection buttons would remain greyed out after a failed SDR connection. Added a status-driven reset and a 15-second safety timeout to ensure the UI remains interactive.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **AI Engine Widget**: New `AIEngineWidget` component in the TopBar exposing a live model-selection dropdown, letting operators switch between AI backends (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, etc.) at runtime without restarting any service.
- **ADSB Military & Drone Alerts**: The alert engine now fires **one-time** tactical alerts when a military aircraft or drone/UAS first appears in the AOR — matching the existing maritime military vessel alert behavior and completing alert parity across all three tracked domains.

### Fixed

- **Orbital Parameters in Right Sidebar (Period & Inclination)**: Corrected camelCase property access after protobuf compilation. `period_min` → `periodMin` and `inclination_deg` → `inclinationDeg` were being read with snake_case names, causing PERIOD and INC to always show "---" in the entity inspector. Now displays live values correctly.
- **Protobuf Schema Sync**: Added `period_min`, `inclination_deg`, and `eccentricity` fields to both `backend/api/proto/tak.proto` and `frontend/public/tak.proto`, and updated `tak_pb2.py` and `tak.py` serialization to populate them from the orbital data stream.
- **AIS Poller Reconnection Churn**: The maritime AIS poller was reconnecting to AISStream.io on every Redis mission-area pub/sub message, causing a cascade of connection timeouts whenever the user rapidly clicked radius presets (30 nm → 100 nm → 150 nm). Fixed with two defenses:
  - **Minimum-change threshold** — ignores updates where lat/lon changes < 0.05° and radius changes < 1 nm, filtering out floating-point drift and same-value re-selections.
  - **5-second debounce** — rapid preset clicks now collapse into a single reconnect once the user stops interacting.
- **AIS Vessel Registration Display**: Extended the right sidebar to surface AIS-specific vessel registration fields (IMO, callsign, flag, draught, destination) when inspecting a maritime contact.
- **Orbital Registration Badge**: The REGISTRATION field in the entity info bar now shows the NORAD catalog number (e.g. "NORAD 52794") for orbital targets instead of the orbital category type string (e.g. "GPS").
- **Orbital Sidebar Compacted**: Collapsed the 3-row NORAD ID / Inclination / Eccentricity block into a single inline line beneath the callsign, saving significant vertical space in the inspector panel.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Alerts Widget**: A new dropdown widget integrated into the TopBar for viewing the latest tactical alerts directly under the "ALERTS" pill.
- **Expanded Alert Detection Engine**: The system now automatically detects and generates tactical alerts for critical conditions across all domains:
  - **Aviation**: Emergency squawk codes (7500, 7600, 7700) and general emergency status flags.
  - **Maritime**: AIS-SART distress signals (NavStatus 14), Not Under Command (NavStatus 2), Aground (NavStatus 6), and initial detections of military vessels or hazardous cargo.
  - **Orbital**: Imminent passes (AOS within 30 minutes) of Intel-category satellites (military reconnaissance, SAR, EO constellations).
- **Persistent Alert State Tracking**: Alerts are intelligently deduplicated per-entity and automatically clear when emergencies resolve, passes conclude, or entities leave the operational area.

### Changed

- **Alerts Widget Styling**: Removed the red outer glow from the alerts panel border in favor of a clean, standard shadow for a more refined look.

### Fixed

- **HUD Z-Indexing**: Explicitly set the TopBar zone's z-index to `z-50` in `MainHud` to ensure that dropdown widgets render correctly over the sidebars and map content.

## [0.18.2] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- **Globe Mode Rendering (Tactical & Orbital Map):**
  - Resolved a platform-level incompatibility that caused Deck.gl layers to go blank when enabling Globe mode with a Mapbox token. Mapbox Globe explicitly blocks `CustomLayerInterface`, which `MapboxOverlay` requires. Both `TacticalMap` and `OrbitalMap` now dynamically switch to the **MapLibre adapter** in Globe mode, falling back to the Mapbox adapter for 2D/3D Mercator views where Mapbox Standard remains available.
  - Fixed an incorrect `map.setProjection()` call in `useMapCamera` that passed the Mapbox-only bare string form (`"globe"`) to a MapLibre instance. The hook now correctly detects the active adapter and passes the MapLibre object form `{ type: "globe" }` when in Globe mode.
  - Fixed a race-condition crash (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'destroy')`) triggered when toggling Globe off. A manual `map.remove()` call was racing with `react-map-gl`'s own internal cleanup — removed the redundant call since the GL context lifecycle is fully managed by `react-map-gl` on unmount.
  - `mapStyle` now correctly switches to the CartoDB Dark Matter style in Globe mode, matching the MapLibre adapter requirement.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- **KiwiNodeBrowser**: Resolved `NaN, NaN` crash in MapLibre by adding defensive guards for invalid coordinates.
- **geoUtils**: Robust Maidenhead grid conversion to handle non-digit characters in square locators.
- **Linting**: Fixed all remaining frontend lint errors (purity, setState in effect, etc.).
- **Branding**: Integrated the official Sovereign Watch cyber-tactical logo into the `README.md` and added a symmetrical text-less favicon to the frontend UI.

### Changed

- **UI Streamlining:**
  - Standardized the "Sovereign Glass" design aesthetic across the entire tactical and orbital HUD.
  - Eliminated harsh 30px drop shadows from the left sidebar widgets (Mission Navigator, Search, JS8, System Status, Intel Feed, Doppler, Altitude/Speed Legends) in favor of a cohesive 12px blur with slight rounded corners, matching the orbital design.
  - Slimmed down the global TopBar height by 10px, refining icon and text padding to eliminate edge-hugging.
  - Revamped the Historian (TimeControls) widget to perfectly align with the glassmorphism properties, active/inactive pill button states (`hud-green` / `amber-500`), and tabular typography of the main HUD.
  - Updated all bottom map controls (2D/3D toggle, Globe toggle, ± Zoom controls, and 3D Rotation/Tilt controls) to use tightly fitted `p-1` and `p-1.5` transparent borders with interactive `bg-white/10` hover states and `hud-green`/`indigo-500` active halos.

### Fixed

- **Visual Regressions:** Addressed text cutoff and vertical misalignment in the Historian widget after structural padding changes.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Nginx Reverse Proxy:** All services now route through a single nginx entry point on **port 80**. The `sovereign-nginx` container proxies `/api/` to the backend, `/ws/js8` to the JS8Call WebSocket bridge, and `/` to the Vite frontend. No other container exposes host ports.
- **KiwiSDR Public Directory Search:** Integrated a new `KiwiDirectory` module in the `js8call` service to fetch and parse the global KiwiSDR receiver list. Features proximity-sorting using Haversine distance and frequency-based filtering to select the optimal SDR node for tactical operations.

### Changed

- **Port Consolidation:** Removed host port mappings from `frontend` (3700), `backend-api` (8000), `js8call` (8082), `timescaledb` (5432), `redis` (6379), and `redpanda` (28081/28082/29092). All inter-service communication routed exclusively over Docker internal networks.
- **Vite Configuration:** Removed the `/api` proxy block (nginx now handles API routing). Set `hmr.clientPort: 80` so Vite HMR WebSocket tunnels correctly through nginx. Set `allowedHosts: true` to allow proxied requests from nginx.
- **Frontend Port:** Vite dev server moved from port 3000 → 3700.
- **Sidebar Glassmorphism Restoration**: Reverted to individual glass containers for each sidebar widget (`Search`, `Mission Navigator`, `Intel Feed`, `JS8`, `Layer Filters`, `System Status`) to restore visual separation and tactical depth.
- **Shadow Refinement**: Toned down the global drop shadow blur from `30px` to `12px` across all glass widgets for a cleaner, high-end aesthetic.
- **Search Widget Enhancement**: Boosted text prominence in the search input using `text-cyan-300`, increased placeholder opacity, and added a subtle cyan outer glow on focus for better interactivity.
- **Tactical Legend Restyling**: Redesigned the `Altitude` and `Maritime` map legends to match the **Mission Navigator** widget's visual language, featuring a header/body structure, `hud-green` tactical typography, and dedicated `Crosshair`/`Anchor` icons.
- **Legend Alignment**: Precisely aligned the map legends to the vertical gutter right of the tactical sidebar to optimize map real estate.
- **JS8Call Backend Architecture:** Replaced the legacy `pyjs8call` bridge with a native **AsyncIO DatagramProtocol** (UDP) implementation to permanently resolve the Qt headless socket thread crash bug on Windows-based hosts.
- **Radio Terminal Styling**: Refined frequency input fields and terminal sidebars with glassmorphism principles.

### Fixed

- **Database Initialization (`init.sql`):** Wrapped `ALTER EXTENSION timescaledb UPDATE` and `CREATE EXTENSION ai` in `DO $$ ... EXCEPTION ... $$` blocks to prevent fatal errors from aborting the init script on fresh volumes. The `ai` extension is unavailable in `timescale/timescaledb-ha:pg16` and the `ALTER EXTENSION` call requires a fresh session context.
- **Idempotent DB Policies:** Added `if_not_exists => true` to `add_compression_policy` and `add_retention_policy` calls in `init.sql` to prevent errors on repeated initializations.
- **JS8Call Bridge Startup:** Fixed a `NameError` in `js8call/server.py` caused by the `logger` variable being used before initialization inside the `kiwi_client` import exception handler. Moved `logging.basicConfig` and `logger` declaration above the `try/except` block.
- **CORS (Backend & JS8Call):** Updated `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to `http://localhost` for both `backend-api` and `js8call` services. With nginx as the single entry point, all browser requests originate from one host — eliminating cross-origin errors.

### Removed

- **Redpanda Console:** Removed the `sovereign-redpanda-console` service. It was a development debugging tool that served no runtime function and conflicts with the single-port architecture. Can be re-added temporarily via `docker compose run` when Kafka topic inspection is needed.

## [0.17.2] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **PVB Satellite Rendering:** Satellites now use Projective Velocity Blending (PVB) for smooth, 60fps rendering in the Orbital map, replacing the previous 5-second snapping updates.
- **Orbital History Tails & Gap Bridges:** Real-time trails are now seamlessly grafted onto the PVB satellite models. A new "Gap Bridge" rendering layer connects the delayed 3D orbital track directly to the live 60fps icon for a fluid UI experience.
- **Right Sidebar Safeguards:** Passing `selectedEntity` conditionally into the `MainHud` right slot prevents the `SidebarRight` transparent container from blocking user mouse events on the underlying tactical map when closed.

### Fixed

- **Gap Bridge Elevation Logic:** The `Gap Bridge` component in `OrbitalLayer` now correctly uses `d.altitude` to position the line segments in 3D space, instead of drawing the orbital trails on the physical ground.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Collapsible Subcategories:** Added stateful chevron toggles to the orbital category pills to collapse and expand constellation lists, saving vertical HUD space.
- **Default Filters:** The Starlink constellation is now disabled by default on fresh loads to prevent overwhelming the browser with 9,000+ entities instantly.
- **Category Pill Refinement:** Removed top-level category counts from the orbital pills to prevent text collision, keeping the UI clean and readable.

### Fixed

- **Constellation Filtering Schema:** Restored the missing `constellation` and `category` fields to the `tak.proto` Protobuf schema, re-enabling selective constellation filtering in the frontend worker and `useAnimationLoop`.
- **Backend Serialization:** Updated the `sovereign-orbital-pulse` and TAK serialization services to correctly map and transmit the restored fields over WebSocket.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Orbital Map: Observer AOI Horizon Ring:** `buildAOTLayers` now renders a soft purple geodesic circle centered on the active mission lat/lon, with radius matching the configured mission area in nautical miles. A small purple dot marks the precise observer position. Works in both mercator and globe projections. The ring updates automatically when the mission area changes.
- **Orbital Map: Right-Click Mission Control:** Right-clicking the orbital map now opens the full `MapContextMenu` (matching the tactical map), exposing **Set Mission Focus**, **Save Location**, and **Return Home** actions. Includes `SaveLocationForm` for bookmarking clicked coordinates. Changing focus also updates the observer AOI ring immediately.
- **Pass Prediction: COMMS Layer Safety Guard (Frontend):** `OrbitalSidebarLeft` now skips the category-level pass prediction request when the active filter is `comms`. The `PassPredictorWidget` displays a clear informational message explaining that individual satellite selection is required for comms pass prediction.
- **Pass Prediction: COMMS Layer Safety Guard (Backend):** `GET /api/orbital/passes` returns `HTTP 400` when `category=comms` is requested without explicit `norad_ids`. Prevents accidental or buggy clients from triggering an 8-10k-satellite SGP4 scan that would OOM the server.

### Fixed

- **SidebarRight Header Clipping:** Removed `overflow-hidden` from the main header `div` in `SidebarRight`. The TYPE_TAG and REGISTRATION badge row was being clipped behind the Position Telemetry section. The header now expands naturally to contain all content.
- **SidebarRight Actions Bar (Satellite Entities):** The TRACK_LOG button and its parent actions bar `div` are now conditionally hidden when viewing satellite entities, preventing phantom spacing and irrelevant controls from appearing in the orbital sidebar.

### Changed

- **`buildAOTLayers`:** Accepts an optional `observer` argument `{ lat, lon, radiusKm }` for the orbital horizon ring. The `ScatterplotLayer` import added alongside the existing `PathLayer`.
- **`useAnimationLoop`:** Added optional `observerRef` parameter (`MutableRefObject<{ lat, lon, radiusKm } | null>`) threaded through to `buildAOTLayers`.
- **`OrbitalMap`:** Maintains an `observerRef` derived from `currentMissionRef`, kept in sync each render cycle.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Satellite Inspector (SidebarRight):** `SatelliteInspectorSection` sub-component shows `inclination_deg` and `eccentricity` in the identity header; live azimuth, elevation, and slant range computed at 1 Hz via `satAzEl()` with green highlight when elevation ≥ 10°; next-pass AOS countdown, max elevation, and duration sourced from `usePassPredictions` filtered by NORAD ID.
- **Pass Predictor UX — Live Countdown:** Each pass row in `PassPredictorWidget` shows a live `T-HH:MM:SS` countdown to AOS. In-progress passes pulse purple and switch to a LOS countdown.
- **Pass Predictor UX — Min Elevation Filter:** `MIN EL: [10° ▾]` dropdown (0/5/10/15/20/30°) added to the pass list header, wired to `usePassPredictions` `minElevation` option.
- **Pass Predictor UX — CSV Export:** Download icon in the pass list header serialises `passes[]` to a `passes_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` file via `Blob` + `createObjectURL`.
- **Category Counts per Pill:** `OrbitalCategoryPills` fetches `GET /api/orbital/stats` on mount and renders per-category satellite counts (e.g., `GPS (127)`).
- **NORAD ID / Name Search:** Compact search input above category pills filters the pass list client-side by name or NORAD ID substring; no additional API call.
- **Predicted Ground Track PathLayer:** When a satellite is selected and history tails are enabled, `OrbitalMap` fetches `/api/orbital/groundtrack/{norad_id}?minutes=90` and renders it as a dashed `PathLayer` (future orbit) via `predictedGroundTrackRef` threaded through `useAnimationLoop`.
- **`GET /api/orbital/stats` Endpoint:** Returns `COUNT GROUP BY category` from the `satellites` table for the category-pill UI.
- **Redis Caching for Pass Predictions:** Pass prediction results are cached in Redis for 5 minutes, keyed by `orbital:passes:{lat}:{lon}:{hours}:{el}:{norad_ids}:{limit}`. Falls back gracefully when Redis is unavailable.
- **Pass Prediction `limit` Param:** `GET /api/orbital/passes` gains a `limit` query parameter (max 500) to cap results returned.
- **`useMissionLocation` Hook:** Extracted shared observer-location resolution (getMissionArea + env-var fallback) used by both `OrbitalSidebarLeft` and `SidebarRight`.
- **`usePassPredictions` `skip` Option:** Suppresses fetches when not applicable (used by `SatelliteInspectorSection` for non-satellite entities).
- **`satAzEl()` Utility:** New `geoUtils.ts` export computing observer→satellite azimuth, elevation, and slant range using spherical ECEF/ENZ math.
- **`GroundTrackPoint` Type:** Exported from `OrbitalLayer.tsx` for use across the ground track data pipeline.

### Changed

- **`OrbitalSidebarLeft`:** Refactored observer location resolution to `useMissionLocation`; `minElevation` state now wired to `usePassPredictions`; search input added above category pills.
- **`SidebarRight`:** Normalised `React.useState`/`React.useEffect` to destructured `useState`/`useEffect`.

### Removed

- **`OrbitalDashboard.tsx`:** Deleted — confirmed unused (App.tsx renders `OrbitalMap` + `OrbitalSidebarLeft` directly). 130 lines of dead code removed.
- **Stale `Satellite` icon import** removed from `OrbitalCategoryPills.tsx`.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Orbital Pass Prediction API:** New `GET /api/orbital/passes` endpoint that computes upcoming satellite passes for an observer location using SGP4 propagation. Returns AOS, TCA, LOS, max elevation, azimuth at AOS/LOS, duration, and a full 10-second point array per pass for polar plot and Doppler rendering.
- **Ground Track API:** New `GET /api/orbital/groundtrack/{norad_id}` endpoint returning lat/lon/alt arrays for one configurable propagation window.
- **Satellites Table:** Persistent `satellites` database table (no retention policy) storing the latest TLE and orbital metadata per NORAD ID, independent of the 24-hour `tracks` hypertable retention.
- **Historian TLE Upsert:** The Historian service now upserts TLE data into `satellites` on every consumed `orbital_raw` Kafka message, ensuring TLEs are always fresh for pass prediction.
- **SGP4 Coordinate Utilities:** New `backend/api/utils/sgp4_utils.py` with TEME→ECEF→topocentric helpers including `ecef_to_topocentric` for azimuth/elevation/slant-range computation.
- **`usePassPredictions` Hook:** React hook that polls `GET /api/orbital/passes` every 5 minutes, cancels in-flight requests on unmount, and returns typed `PassResult[]` data.
- **Live Widget Wiring:** `OrbitalSidebarLeft` now feeds live pass data to `PassPredictorWidget`, `DopplerWidget`, and `PolarPlotWidget` using the active mission area as the observer location.

### Changed

- **`OrbitalSidebarLeft`:** Replaced hardcoded empty arrays with live data from `usePassPredictions`; observer lat/lon sourced from `getMissionArea()` with env var fallback.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **Orbital UI Polish:** Refactored the orbital dashboard sidebars and filters to align perfectly with the established tactical UI schema.
- **Globe Rendering:** Removed the artificial radial vignette from the main HUD shell to provide a cleaner void background for the 3D globe.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- **Orbital Synchronization Suite:**
  - **Dedicated Orbital Dashboard:** A new high-performance tracking suite for space-based assets, featuring its own TopBar navigation pill.
  - **3D Globe Visualization:** Integrated a spherical projection mode specifically for orbital situational awareness, providing a global perspective on satellite constellations.
  - **High-Frequency Propagation:** Reduced the satellite positional update interval from 30s to 5s in the `orbital-pulse` poller for near-real-time accuracy.
  - **Satellite Inspector:** New side-panel for deep-diving into orbital parameters (inclination, eccentricity, period, NORAD ID) and Celestrak category metadata.
  - **Orbital Category Filtering:** Dynamic pill-based filtering for GPS, COMMS, WEATHER, and INTEL orbital groups.
  - **Coverage Footprints:** Real-time 2D coverage visualization for the selected satellite based on its current altitude.
  - **Terminator Layer:** Real-time day/night shadow overlay across both Tactical and Orbital maps for operational context.

### Changed

- **Tactical UI Alignment:**
  - Reordered TopBar navigation to "Tactical | Orbital | Radio" to prioritize the two primary map domains.
  - Aligned Tactical Map zoom controls to the bottom-center for a unified HUD aesthetic.
  - Consolidated "Ground Tracks" and "History Trails" into a single global state for reduced visual clutter.

### Fixed

- **Orbital Map Stability:**
  - Restricted global footprint rendering to preventing WebGL context crashes with 10k+ entities.
  - Fixed a terminator toggle bug where the layer would remain stuck in "ON" mode across view transitions.

## [0.13.3] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **Globe 3D Rendering & Projections:**
  - Fixed an issue in Mapbox v3 Globe mode where Deck.gl layers (undersea cables, satellites, repeaters) would clip through the Earth when the camera was tilted. Added explicit `depthBias` to all layer builders (`-210.0` to `-100.0`).
  - Implemented dynamic `wrapLongitude` disabling to prevent visual artifacting and streaking when the map is in spherical projection.
  - Mitigated a "Planet Sized Satellite" visual bug by capping the maximum pixel-to-degree scaling radius of `OrbitalLayer` assets based on altitude, preventing over-expansion at low zoom levels.
  - Disabled explicit forced `GlobeView` projection in the DeckGL MapboxAdapter, allowing it to natively read the Mapbox camera matrix for `_full3d` synchronization.

### Known Issues

- **Mapbox v3 Parallax Drift:** Mapbox GL JS v3 explicitly drops support for custom interleaved WebGL layers when rendering the Globe projection. Because Deck.gl is forced to render on a separate `<canvas>`, its 3D camera matrix exhibits minor "parallax drift" / expansion compared to the Mapbox globe when the camera is heavily pitched. Full interleaved support remains fully functional with MapLibre.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **JS8Call Container Runtime:** Fixed a crucial issue preventing the `js8call` container from starting on Windows-based host machines. Added a `.gitattributes` file to enforce `LF` line endings across all shell scripts and Docker files, preventing fatal `\r` (CRLF) errors during execution inside the Linux container.
- **Database Initialization:** Re-aligned `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment defaults to prevent authentication failures when standing up fresh TimescaleDB volumes.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- **Repeater Infrastructure Cache:** Implemented a new Demand-Driven Redis cache (24h TTL) in the `/api/repeaters` endpoint to prevent redundant external API calls.

### Fixed

- **Infinite Re-Renders:** Resolved a critical infinite re-render loop (`Maximum update depth exceeded`) in `useInfraData` that was triggered by unstable object references.
- **Repeater API Authentication:** Fixed a `502 Bad Gateway` error on the RepeaterBook integration by adding support for `REPEATERBOOK_API_TOKEN` bearer authentication to comply with upstream security changes.
- **Async LLM Blocking (NEW-003):** Migrated the Analysis API's streaming generator to use `acompletion` and `async for`, preventing LLM streaming from blocking the FastAPI event loop.
- **API Validation & Cleanup (NEW-001, NEW-002, NEW-004, NEW-005):** Added lower-bound validation to replay endpoints, removed deprecated asyncio loop calls, and cleared residual debug logs from production.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Stability Audit (20 bugs resolved across 13 files):**
  - **BUG-001** — Aviation Poller double rate-limiter: Removed redundant `async with source.limiter` wrapper in `source_loop()`. The inner `_fetch()` already holds the limiter; double-acquisition halved the effective polling rate.
  - **BUG-002** — Historian shutdown data loss: Added batch flush in the `finally` block before consumer teardown. In-flight data was silently discarded on SIGTERM.
  - **BUG-003** — Signal handler `asyncio.create_task()` crash: Changed to `loop.create_task()` in both `aviation_poller/main.py` and `maritime_poller/main.py`. Signal handlers run outside the async context, making `asyncio.create_task()` raise `RuntimeError`.
  - **BUG-004** — Analysis API crash on NULL `avg_speed`/`avg_alt`: Added `or 0` guards before `.1f`/`.0f` format specifiers. `PostgreSQL AVG()` returns `None` on all-NULL groups, causing `TypeError`.
  - **BUG-005** — Blocking LLM call stalling event loop: Wrapped synchronous `litellm.completion()` in `asyncio.to_thread()` within the analysis SSE generator, restoring API concurrency.
  - **BUG-006** — Replay endpoint accepts reversed time windows: Added `dt_end <= dt_start` validation; previously a negative duration silently produced empty results.
  - **BUG-007** — Track history accepts zero/negative `limit` and `hours`: Added positive-value guard on both query parameters.
  - **BUG-008** — CORS misconfiguration (`allow_credentials=True` with `allow_origins=["*"]`): Removed `allow_credentials` from JS8Call bridge CORSMiddleware — the combination is rejected by all browsers per spec.
  - **BUG-009** — Historian silently drops batch when DB pool unavailable: Retained batch and logged a warning instead of clearing; data is retried on the next flush cycle.
  - **BUG-010** — ECEF→LLA division by zero at the poles: Clamped `lat` with `np.clip` before dividing by `cos(lat)` in `orbital_pulse/utils.py`.
  - **BUG-011** — Deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` in JS8Call WebSocket handlers: Replaced with `asyncio.get_running_loop()` (correct inside a running coroutine, Python 3.10+).
  - **BUG-012** — Historian clears batch after write failure: Moved `batch.clear()` inside the `try` block so data is only discarded after a confirmed successful DB write.
  - **BUG-013** — Debug `console.log` in production hot paths: Removed 5 console log calls from WebSocket connect/open/close, followMode effect, and map load events.
  - **BUG-014** — Redundant inner `if action == "SEND"` guard in JS8Call WebSocket handler: Removed always-True dead check and unified variable naming.
  - **BUG-015** — Duplicate DR-state lookup in `useEntityWorker.ts`: Consolidated `currentDr` / `previousDr` (identical `drStateRef.current.get()` calls before any write) into a single `existingDr`.
  - **BUG-016** — `_message_queue` type annotation in JS8Call server: Corrected from `asyncio.Queue` → `Optional[asyncio.Queue]` to match actual `None` initialization.
  - **BUG-017** — Deprecated `@app.on_event("startup/shutdown")` lifecycle hooks: Migrated `backend/api/main.py` to the modern `@asynccontextmanager` `lifespan` pattern (FastAPI ≥ 0.93).
  - **BUG-018** — Hex debug computation in protobuf decode hot path: Removed `Array.from().map().join()` byte-to-hex conversion that ran on every decoded TAK message; no UI feature consumed `.raw`.
  - **BUG-019** — AIS magic number 511: Defined `AIS_HEADING_NOT_AVAILABLE = 511` module constant (per ITU-R M.1371) and replaced bare literals in both position report handlers.
  - **BUG-020** — AISStream bounding box unclamped latitude: Clamped `min_lat`/`max_lat` to `[-90.0, 90.0]` in `maritime_poller/utils.py` to prevent invalid subscription coordinates for large-radius or polar-centered AORs.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Drone Classification Accuracy (ADS-B Aviation Poller):**
  - Introduced dedicated constants for Military, Commercial, Civil, and Generic UAS identification strings.
  - Improved `classify_aircraft` detection logic, now cross-referencing ICAO category, type code, description, squawk code, operator, callsign, and registration fields for higher-confidence classification.
  - Added granular `drone_class` sub-assignments (`MILITARY_UAS`, `COMMERCIAL_UAS`, `CIVIL_UAS`, `UNKNOWN_UAS`) emitted alongside `aircraft_class = "drone"` in the classification payload.
  - Expanded `test_classification.py` with comprehensive drone fixture coverage to prevent classification regressions.

- **API Security — Information Disclosure via Error Handling:**
  - Hardened `backend/api/routers/analysis.py` and `backend/api/routers/system.py` to suppress internal stack traces and implementation details from HTTP error responses (MEDIUM severity).
  - Structured error responses now return generic operator-safe messages, preventing inadvertent leakage of backend internals to external callers.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **Undersea Infrastructure Awareness:**
  - **Submarine Cable Layer:** New Deck.gl map layer rendering the global submarine cable network with per-cable color coding sourced from SubmarineCableMap.com.
  - **Landing Stations Layer:** Independent toggle for submarine cable landing points, visualized as colored dots matching their cable's signature color.
  - **Infrastructure Tooltips:** Specialized tactical tooltips for cables (name, length, owners, status) and landing stations (name, country, connected cables).
  - **Intelligence Feed Integration:** Automatic Intel Feed notifications when submarine cable or landing station layers are toggled on/off.
  - **24h Client Cache:** Submarine cable + landing station GeoJSON cached in `localStorage` to minimize external API calls.

- **RF Infrastructure Enhancements:**
  - **Tactical Clustering (Refined):** Refactored the repeater clustering algorithm: tighter grid grouping, Emerald-themed halos (replacing off-theme Violet), reduced visual weight of cluster bubbles, and a higher zoom breakpoint (7.5) for better density management in high-repeater regions like the Pacific Northwest.
  - **Intelligence Feed Notifications:** Toggle-on/off events for RF repeaters now fire in the Intel Feed, consistent with all other map layers.
  - **Notification Race Fix:** Fixed a race condition where the Intel Feed would report "0 repeaters" before data had loaded. The gate now waits for a non-zero count or a confirmed loading cycle before broadcasting.
  - **Globe Mode Optimization:** RF repeater dots fully billboard in globe mode with correct `depthBias` to prevent half-moon clipping.
  - **Callsign Labels:** Repeater callsigns and frequencies appear at zoom ≥ 9 as tactical overlays.

- **Infrastructure Color System:**
  - Standardized **Emerald-400** (`#34D399`) as the canonical color for all RF Infrastructure elements (Repeaters, JS8Call indicators, status messages).
  - Standardized **Cyan-400** (`#22D3EE`) as the canonical color for all Undersea Infrastructure elements (Cables, Landing Stations).
  - Updated `SystemStatus.tsx`, `LayerFilters.tsx`, `IntelFeed.tsx`, and `MapTooltip.tsx` to reflect the new scheme consistently.
  - Header toggle buttons for each infrastructure group now match their assigned color.

### Changed

- **HUD Terminology:** Renamed "Total Objects" → "Total Tracking" in `SystemStatus.tsx` for more accurate tactical terminology.
- **Landing Stations Default:** Landing stations now default to **OFF** when submarine cables are first enabled, preventing UI overload on first toggle.
- **Architecture Diagram:** Fixed a node ID collision in `README.md` Mermaid diagram (node `J` was dual-assigned to JS8Call and Claude). Added RF Repeaters, Submarine Cables, and Infrastructure Layers to the Presentation block.
- **Data Sources Documentation:** Added a comprehensive `## 🗂️ Data Sources` section to `README.md` documenting all upstream APIs with URLs, auth requirements, and caching behavior.

### Fixed

- **`ReferenceError` in `IntelFeed.tsx`:** Restored missing variable declarations that were causing the intelligence stream to crash on toggle.
- **Map Tooltip Sync:** Verified and corrected tooltip color themes for Repeaters (Emerald), Cables (Cyan), and JS8Call stations.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- **RF Infrastructure Intelligence:**
  - **Repeater Network Layer:** Integrated a new map layer for tracking and visualizing Amateur Radio Repeaters.
  - **Tactical Repeater Sidebar:** Created a custom sidebar for visualizing detailed telemetry (Frequency, Offset, CTCSS, Modes, Use, Status, Location) when selecting a repeater.
  - **Repeater API:** Added backend endpoints `/api/repeaters` to support the new UI elements.

### Changed

- **Tactical UI Polish:**
  - **Consolidated Layers Filter:** Eliminated the standalone `MapLayersWidget` and beautifully integrated the Map Layers toggle directly into the header of the **System Status (Total Objects)** widget to preserve HUD real-estate.

## [0.10.4] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- **Orbital Entity Tooltips:**
  - Added an `isOrbital` type check to `MapTooltip.tsx` to ensure satellites display correct purple tactical styling.
  - Orbital tooltips now output speeds accurately in `km/s` instead of converting `kts`.
  - Updated icon to `Satellite` instead of `Plane` for orbital metadata popups.

## [0.10.3] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Sovereign Glass UI:**
  - **Sky Atmosphere:** Enabled a native `sky` layer in MapLibre Globe mode, providing a deep navy horizon-to-space gradient and realistic solar orientation.

### Changed

- **Globe Rendering Overhaul:**
  - **Polygon-Based Tactical Symbols:** Replaced `IconLayer` chevrons with geographic `PolygonLayer` triangles in Globe mode. This completely bypasses MapLibre v5 billboarding/depth-testing bugs, ensuring entities drape perfectly over the 3D sphere and scale/rotate with zero artifacts.
  - **Optimized Zoom Fly-out:** Adjusted globe transition easing to prioritize stability at high altitudes.

### Fixed

- **MapLibre Logic Stability:**
  - **Redundant Atmosphere Triggers:** Added protective guards and deferred one-tick execution (`setTimeout`) to prevent style-clobbering when simultaneously switching projection and adding sky layers.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Backend Architecture:**
  - **Broadcast WebSocket Service:** Implemented a new `BroadcastManager` service for `/api/tracks/live`, shifting Kafka consumer overhead from O(N) to O(1) and drastically increasing throughput for concurrent clients.

### Changed

- **Tactical UI:**
  - **JS8Widget Streamlining:** The JS8Call widget now defaults to a collapsed state to preserve screen real estate, keeping the critical station status bar (callsign, grid, frequency, online status) permanently visible.
  - **Radio Terminal Cleanup:** Removed the redundant status footer from the Radio Terminal since the information is naturally represented elsewhere.

### Optimized

- **Maritime Poller Performance:**
  - **Non-blocking Kafka Sends:** Switched to non-blocking Kafka sends in the maritime poller's ingestion loop, mitigating network latency blocks and boosting throughput by ~35x.

### Fixed

- **Data Integrity & Security:**
  - **History Validation:** Added bounded input validation for `limit` and `hours` query parameters in the `get_track_history` endpoint to prevent resource exhaustion and potential DoS attacks.
- **Code Health & Configuration:**
  - **Dynamic Kafka Broker:** Replaced hardcoded broker references with the `KAFKA_BROKERS` environment variable in the API core configuration.
- **Globe Rendering Architecture:**
  - **Icon Visibility Issues:** Disabled `wrapLongitude` in Globe projection mode across multiple tactical layers (`entity-tactical-halo`, `satellite-markers`, `js8-labels`) to resolve Deck.gl billboarding conflicts that caused entity icons to disappear.
- **JS8Call UI Synchronization:**
  - **Frequency Sync:** Corrected an issue where the JS8Call widget and Radio Terminal would display stale frequency data. They now bind directly to the validated `activeKiwiConfig` payload via WebSocket.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **JS8Call Headless Thread Crash:** Re-engineered the FastAPI bridge to use native AsyncIO Datagram (UDP) Protocol instead of TCP. This completely bypasses a fatal Qt `QNativeSocketEngine` thread collision that occurred when connecting to headless JS8Call over Xvfb, permanently restoring live telemetry to the Radio Terminal.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **JS8Call Tactical Bridge:** Integrated the `js8call` service via Docker, enabling HF digital mode communication within the Sovereign Watch ecosystem.
- **JS8Call HUD Widget:** New interactive sidebar widget for real-time tactical chat, frequency control, and station health monitoring.
- **Tactical Map Integration:** JS8Call stations are now visualized on the map as specialized tactical entities with live status indicators.
- **KIWI_RX Audio Pipeline:** Implemented a robust virtual audio pipeline for JS8Call using PulseAudio null-sinks, allowing seamless ingestion from network SDRs.
- **TopBar Streamlining:** Redesigned the top navigation bar with a compact view switcher (Globe vs Radio), an icon-based status bar, and subtle UI animations.
- **Dynamic Alerts & Tactical Clock:** Replaced the static alerts text with a pulsing red tactical pill and upgraded the UTC clock to a segmented green ZULU HUD display.
- **Tactical Map Zoom Controls:** Integrated floating `+` and `-` zoom controls on the tactical map for precise view adjustments.

### Improved

- **Service Resilience:** Enhanced `js8call` container entrypoint with robust PulseAudio discovery and health checks.
- **Infrastructure Orchestration:** Unified tactical services in `docker-compose.yml` with optimized volume sharing for audio and configuration persistent state.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- **Critical System Stability:**
  - **API Startup:** Fixed a critical `NameError` crash in `backend/api/main.py` by adding a missing `import os`.
  - **Redis Key Mismatch:** Corrected `backend/ingestion/maritime_poller/service.py` to use the standardized `mission:active` Redis key, ensuring the maritime poller respects the active mission area.
  - **Memory Leaks & Stale State:** Fixed critical stale closures in `frontend/src/hooks/useAnimationLoop.ts` by correctly managing `aotShapes`, `hoveredEntity`, and `selectedEntity` dependencies, preventing UI state drift.
  - **Kafka Consumer Cleanup:** Removed `group_id` from the API track consumer to enable true "Broadcast Mode" and prevent the accumulation of thousands of orphaned consumer groups on the Redpanda broker.

- **Data Integrity & Visualization:**
  - **Mission Switching Teleport Glitch:** Implemented `visualStateRef` clearing in `useMissionArea.ts` to prevent entity "teleportation" artifacts when switching mission areas.
  - **Ground Vehicle Classification:** Correctly mapped ADS-B categories C1 (Emergency), C2 (Service), and C3 (Obstacle) to Ground Vehicle types (`a-f-G-E-V-C`) to prevent them from appearing as ships.
  - **Orbital Count in HUD:** Updated `onCountsUpdate` to include orbital asset counts, fixing the "0" satellite count bug in the sidebar.

- **Performance & Reliability:**
  - **Orbital Propagation:** Vectorized the SGP4 satellite propagation loop in `backend/ingestion/orbital_pulse/service.py`, replacing slow iterative Python loops with optimized `sgp4_array` calls for a massive performance boost.
  - **Maritime Poller Resilience:** Implemented a robust connection retry loop in the maritime `navigation_listener` to recover automatically from Redis outages.
  - **Graceful Shutdown:** Added `SIGTERM` handling to the maritime poller and modernized `asyncio` loop management in the aviation poller to ensure clean container shutdowns.
  - **Redis Compatibility:** Updated Redis connection closing logic to support `aclose()` for compatibility with redis-py 5.x.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Frontend Testing Infrastructure:**
  - **Vitest Integration:** Added `vitest` and test scripts to the frontend project for unit testing.
  - **GeoUtils Testing:** Implemented comprehensive unit tests for `chaikinSmooth` geometric algorithm in `utils/map/geoUtils.test.ts`.

### Refactored

- **Code Deduplication:** Removed duplicate `chaikinSmooth` implementation from `OrbitalLayer.tsx` and centralized usage to `utils/map/geoUtils.ts`.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-02-24

### Optimized

- **Aviation Poller Performance:**
  - **Background Cache Eviction:** Moved the `evict_stale_entries` operation from the synchronous ingestion loop to a dedicated background task.
  - **Reduced Latency:** Eliminated a ~4ms blocking call per aircraft batch, significantly improving throughput under high load.
  - **Configurable Interval:** Added `ARBITRATION_CLEANUP_INTERVAL` (default: 30s) to control the frequency of cache cleanup.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-02-24

### Refactored

- **TacticalMap Modularization (Structural — no behavioral changes):**
  - **Decomposed monolith:** `TacticalMap.tsx` reduced from **2,762 lines → 556 lines** (80% reduction) by extracting all logic into purpose-scoped modules.
  - **New hooks:**
    - `hooks/useEntityWorker.ts` (561L) — TAK worker lifecycle, WebSocket management, dead-reckoning state
    - `hooks/useAnimationLoop.ts` (733L) — RAF loop, PVB interpolation, per-frame layer assembly
    - `hooks/useMapCamera.ts` (237L) — globe projection switching, graticule overlay, 3D terrain/fog
    - `hooks/useMissionArea.ts` (303L) — mission area polling, AOT geometry calculation, entity clearing
  - **New layer builders:**
    - `layers/buildAOTLayers.ts` (52L) — maritime box + aviation circle `PathLayer`s
    - `layers/buildTrailLayers.ts` (137L) — history trail + gap-bridge `PathLayer`/`LineLayer`

  - **New utilities:**
    - `utils/map/colorUtils.ts` (86L) — altitude/speed color gradient functions
    - `utils/map/geoUtils.ts` (142L) — haversine, bearing, Chaikin smoothing, graticule, zoom helpers
    - `utils/map/iconAtlas.ts` (60L) — canvas icon-atlas singleton
  - **Lazy-loaded adapter selection:** `TacticalMap.tsx` now dynamically picks Mapbox vs. MapLibre adapter via `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` using `React.lazy`.
  - **TypeScript health:** Pre-existing error count reduced from **56 → 33**; zero new errors introduced.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-02-23

### Refactored

- **Backend Architecture:**
  - **Modular API Structure:** Decomposed the monolithic `backend/api/main.py` into a scalable package structure with `routers`, `services`, `core`, and `models`.
  - **Core Logic Migration:** Centralized configuration (`config.py`) and database management (`database.py`) in the `core` module.
  - **Service Extraction:** Moved background tasks (`historian`) and protocol helpers (`tak`) to dedicated `services` modules.
  - **Route Separation:** Split API endpoints into `system`, `tracks`, and `analysis` routers for better organization.
- **Aviation Poller:**
  - **Renaming:** Renamed `backend/ingestion/poller` to `backend/ingestion/aviation_poller` to clearly distinguish it from other ingestion sources.
  - **Code Modularization:** Refactored the aviation poller into `service.py`, `classification.py`, `arbitration.py`, and `utils.py`, with a clean `main.py` entry point.
  - **Docker Configuration:** Updated `docker-compose.yml` to reflect the new build context for the `adsb-poller` service.
- **Maritime Poller:**
  - **Code Modularization:** Refactored `backend/ingestion/maritime_poller` into `service.py`, `classification.py`, and `utils.py` for consistency and maintainability.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Globe Rendering Architecture:**
  - **Interleaved Binding Reversion:** Explicitly disabled interleaved mode in `TacticalMap` (`interleaved: false`) and restored the pure `useControl` prop passthrough in `MapboxAdapter.tsx` to ensure absolute stability and prevent "double-wrapping" projection crashes in Deck.GL v9.
  - **Explicit Projection Mapping:** Manually pass `projection: { name: 'globe' }` to the `MapboxOverlay` init when in globe mode to correctly warp the 2D WebGL canvas over Mapbox's 3D sphere without requiring interleave integration.
  - **Camera Synchronization:** Removed the hardcoded `viewState` lock in `deckProps` for globe mode, allowing the 2D Deck.GL overlay to natively query Mapbox for real-time pitch and bearing during rotation and panning.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Tactical Compass Restoration:**
  - **HUD HUD Restoration:** Restored internal tactical crosshairs and degree ticks to the `Compass.tsx` component.
  - **Dynamic Scaling:** Implemented full dynamic scaling for all compass elements (needle, tail, glow) to support any `size` prop.
  - **Structural Alignment:** Refactored the internal rendering structure to ensure background glow effects remain perfectly centered during layout shifts.
- **Enhanced Entity Tracking:**
  - **Sidebar Size Increase:** Upscaled the tracking compass to 180px in the right sidebar for maximum legibility.

### Changed

- **UI Streamlining:**
  - **Sidebar Cleanup:** Removed the redundant "Classification" row from the Metadata Source section to reduce visual clutter.
  - **Intel Feed Refinement:** Stripped redundant category info from orbital event messages, relying on dedicated tactical badges instead.

### Fixed

- **Compass Aesthetics:** Fixed a bug where cardinal labels (N, E, S, W) were hardcoded to green; they now correctly inherit the target's theme-matched accent color.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Satellite-First Intelligence Integration:**
  - **Orbital Object Counter:** Integrated satellites into the `SystemStatus` widget. The "Total Objects" calculation now includes Aviation, Maritime, and Orbital assets with a dedicated purple visual metric.
  - **Selected Satellite Events:** Selecting a satellite on the map now triggers a categorized event in the `IntelFeed`, complete with specialized satellite icons and purple accenting.
  - **Orbital Feed Filtering:** Users can now toggle orbital-specific intelligence events independently within the stream.

### Changed

- **Signal Source Nomenclature:** Standardized the satellite signal source label to `ORBITAL_Poller` in the detailed sidebar.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Tactical Halo System (Sovereign Glass refinement):**
  - **Locked-to-Icon Highlighting:** Replaced redundant amber icon outlines with a procedural "Tactical Halo" sprite.
  - **Concentric Rendering:** Redesigned as a soft 32px radial glow that perfectly tracks icon billboarding, rotation, and projection in Globe/3D views.
- **Globe View Activation:**
  - **Spherical Projection:** Enabled native globe rendering in `TacticalMap.tsx`, supported by Mapbox v3+ or the newly verified MapLibre v5 upgrade.
  - **Projection Stabilization:** Re-aligned all tactical overlays (trails, footprints, stems) to track accurately on spherical surfaces with zero terrestrial clipping.
- **Unified Tactical UI:**
  - **Map View Control Relocation:** Moved the 2D/3D and Globe View toggles from the global `TopBar.tsx` directly onto the `TacticalMap.tsx` map surface for localized, context-aware interaction.
  - **Topbar Cleanup:** Removed the redundant `Orb_Layer` and map projection buttons from the Topbar to maximize HUD space for mission-critical intelligence.
  - **Layer Filter Header Refinement:** Relocated the expansion chevrons (AIR, SEA, ORBITAL) to the right-side gutter for cleaner visual alignment with toggle switches.
  - **Orbital Header Unification:** Standardized the ORBITAL filter group to match the AIR and SEA tactical styles.

### Changed

- **Tactical Depth Matrix:** Standardized `depthBias` across the entire map stack:
  1. Velocity Vectors (`-220.0`)
  2. Selection Ring (`-215.0`)
  3. Primary Icon (`-210.0`)
  4. Tactical Halo (`-209.0`)
  5. Trails / Footprints (`-101.0`)
  6. Altitude Stems (`-100.0`)
- **Visual Stylization:** Upgraded velocity vectors and ground tracks to `jointRounded` and `capRounded` PathLayers for professional tactical aesthetics.

- **Special Entity Metadata:** Suppressed redundant `GENERAL_AVIATION` tags for specialized assets (Drones, Helicopters) in the HUD.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- **Orbital Pulse Ingestion (Backend):**
  - **Celestrak Tracking:** New `sovereign-orbital-pulse` Python service continually fetching TLEs for active satellites across five categories (GPS, Weather, Active, Surveillance, Comms).
  - **Live SGP4 Propagation:** In-memory numpy-accelerated 30s micro-batched positional resolution simulating live orbit characteristics.
  - **Kafka Ingestion:** Produces `a-s-K` TAK Protocol messages to a new `orbital_raw` Redpanda topic.
- **Orbital Visualization Layer (Frontend):**
  - **Deck.gl Overlays:** Implemented `OrbitalLayer.tsx` featuring marker rendering, continuous ground-track projection, and orbital footprints.
  - **Satellite Telemetry UI:** Enriched `SidebarRight.tsx` with orbital contact metadata — altitude (km), velocity (km/s), orbital period, NORAD ID, and category.
  - **Layer Filtering:** Robust satellite-category filtering (`GPS`, `Weather`, `Comms`, `Surveillance`) integrated into global layer controls and `TacticalMap.tsx`.
  - **AOR Intel Feeds:** Footprint-overlap detection emits categorized `orbital` INTEL events for satellites passing over the mission AOR.
- **Orbital Layer TopBar Controls:** Added `Orb_Layer` and `Globe_View` toggle buttons to `TopBar.tsx`, state persisted to `localStorage`.
- **Globe View Groundwork:** Full wiring implemented through `App.tsx`, `TopBar.tsx`, and `TacticalMap.tsx`. Dual-path projection logic ready — `map.setProjection()` (Mapbox GL v3+) with style-injection fallback (MapLibre GL). Pending MapLibre GL v5 upgrade to activate.

### Fixed

- **Satellite Category Filtering:** Corrected category extraction path `entity.detail?.category ?? entity.detail?.classification?.category` — sub-filters (GPS/Weather/Comms/Surveillance) were silently passing all satellites through.
- **Satellite Color Synchronization:** `getSatColor()` in `OrbitalLayer.tsx` now exactly matches filter chip colors in `LayerFilters.tsx` (GPS→`sky-400`, Weather→`amber-400`, Comms→`emerald-400`, Surveillance→`rose-400`).
- **Intel Stream Noise:** Suppressed per-frame `onEvent` calls from orbital footprint detections that flooded the intelligence feed.

### Known Issues / Technical Debt

- **Globe View Requires MapLibre GL v5:** `setProjection()` is not present in MapLibre GL JS v3.x. The button UI and code wiring are complete; activation requires upgrading `maplibre-gl` to v5 (see `FEATURE-ROADMAP-PHASE-8.md` for research checklist).

## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- **Maritime Ingestion Payload Enhancement:** Extended the AIS poller to ingest `ShipStaticData` and `StandardClassBPositionReport`. Built specific ship cache handling with TTL cleanup for dynamic metadata enrichment.
- **TAK Protocol Evolution:** Upgraded the TAK Protocol (`tak.proto`) to include granular `vesselClassification` attributes (ship category, nav status, flag, dimensions, etc).
- **Expanded Filtering Matrix:** Added detailed sub-class toggles in `IntelFeed` and `TacticalMap` to separate sea traffic into 11 categories (Cargo, Tanker, Fishing, SAR, Military, Tug, etc) plus Drones for the air.
- **Tactical Entity Selection:** Added tactical orange outline and text color highlighting for priority special entities (SAR, Military, Law enforcement vessels, helicopters, drones) across the map and HUD.

### Changed

- **UI Streamlining**: Reduced visual clutter in `LayerFilters.tsx` by eliminating redundant collection headers.
- **Filter Harmonization**: Mapped "unknown" maritime objects intelligently to the `showSpecial` filter across both live intelligence and map replays.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Dead Reckoning Heading Fallback:** Corrected a read-after-write bug where `drStateRef.current.get()` was called after `drStateRef.current.set()` for the same entity. The previous position used for bearing calculation was always identical to the new position (distance = 0), making the kinematic heading fallback dead code. New entities and entities with short trails now compute heading correctly from delta position.
- **Animation Loop Smoothing After Pause:** Capped the lerp `smoothDt` to 33ms independently of the outer `dt` (which is capped at 100ms for physics safety). At `dt=100ms` the old `smoothFactor` reached ~0.73, causing a 73% position jump in one frame when resuming after a GC pause or tab-switch. The new cap keeps blending gradual on resume.
- **Icon Rotation at 0°/360° Boundary:** `blendCourseRad` is now normalized to `[0°, 360°]` before being assigned as the entity `course`. The angle interpolation code uses `[-π, π]` range internally, which could produce negative degree values and incorrect icon rotation direction when crossing north.
- **ADS-B MLAT Duplicate Suppression:** Raised `ARBI_MIN_SPATIAL_M` from 30m to 100m in the backend poller arbitration logic. MLAT multilateration noise across ground station networks is typically 50–150m; the old 30m threshold caused reports from two sources triangulating the same aircraft to both bypass the temporal gate and publish near-simultaneous snapping position updates.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **History Trail Artifacts:**
  - **Zigzag Elimination:** Implemented temporal (3s) and spatial (50m) gating to prevent noisy ADS-B updates from creating sawtooth patterns in history trails.
  - **Detached Head Fix:** Added a dynamic "Gap Bridge" render layer that visually connects the last confirmed history point to the live interpolated entity, ensuring trails look continuous without corruption.
- **Intelligence Stream Performance:**
  - **Memory Cap:** Limited client-side event retention to 500 items to prevent heap bloat.
  - **Render Limit:** Restricted simultaneous DOM nodes in the Intel Feed to the latest 50 events to maintain 60fps UI performance.

### Added

- **Trail Visualization:**
  - **Selected Entity Bridge:** High-priority gap bridging for the currently selected target to ensure immediate visual feedback during tracking.

- **Granular HUD Filters:** Added specialized toggles for Military, Government, Commercial (including Regional/Cargo sub-types), Private (Business Jets/Light Aircraft), and Helicopter assets.
- **Smooth Kinematic Rendering:**
  - **Rotation Interpolation:** Icons now glide smoothly between headings during turns instead of snapping.
  - **Stable History Trails:** Implemented "Lead-in" visual head logic and 50m noise filtering to ensure trails are smooth and perfectly aligned with aircraft movement.
- **Intelligence Event Management:**
  - **Time-Based Expiration:** Intel feed now uses a 1-hour rolling window with automatic data purging to prevent performance degradation and maintain tactical relevance.

### Changed

- **Tactical Zoom Defaults:**
  - Search Result Zoom: Adjusted from 14 to **12**.
  - Intel Stream Zoom: Adjusted from 14 to **12**.
- **Entity Selection:** Standardized selection handlers to strictly disable "Follow Mode" effectively when context switching.

### Fixed

- **Follow Mode:**
  - **Soft Lock Fix:** Fixed "soft lock" issues where manual interaction wouldn't reliably break the camera lock.
  - **Easing Conflict:** Restored `isEasing` checks to prevent camera conflicts during fly-to operations.
  - **Grace Period:** Increased grace period to 3s to improve lock-on reliability for distant targets.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Projective Velocity Blending (PVB):**
  - **Rendering Engine Upgrade:** Replaced legacy dead reckoning with a physics-based velocity projection system.
  - **Zero Rubber-Banding:** Algorithms now project _forward_ from the last known visual state, eliminating backward correction jumps.
  - **Smooth Transitions:** 3-step interpolation (Server Projection -> Client Projection -> Blend) ensures fluid motion for high-speed assets.

### Changed

- **Performance Tuning:**
  - **Animation Loop:** Optimized `TacticalMap` render loop to use refs, eliminating ~30Hz cleanup/setup cycles during selection updates.

    - Added 30m spatial bypass to instantly capture fast maneuvers (high-G turns) that would otherwise be rate-limited.

### Fixed

- **Motion Artifacts:**
  - Fixed "backward snapping" when new packets arrived with slightly older timestamps or different latency profiles.
  - Fixed stationary entity drift by implementing strict speed clamping (< 0.5 m/s).

  - **Live Updates:** Real-time property updates for selected entities in the sidebar.
  - **Unified 3D Centering:** Implemented `getCompensatedCenter` to ensure the camera focus remains on the aircraft chevron rather than the ground, accounting for pitch and altitude.
- **Synchronized Telemetry:** Sidebar numbers now update at 30Hz in perfect lockstep with the map's interpolated camera movement.
- **Intelligent Zoom Defaults:** The "Center" action now uses **Zoom 12** as its tactical default and respects manual zoom levels within the 12-18 range.

### Changed
